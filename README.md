# datalad-gooey-windows-installer

This repository contains code to build a windows installer for [datalad-gooey](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-gooey).
It uses a windows-server github action to execute a Powershell script that collects the installer-components and an
NSIS-spec that specifies the installer creation.
